Academic
======
### Winter School on Numerical Relativity and Gravitational Waves, _2024.01.29 - 2024.02.02_
* Attended sessions covering numerical analysis on ordinary differential equations, AI applications in science, Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods in gravitational wave data analysis, and the evolution of binary compact stars. 
* Analyzed gravitational wave data using PyCBC, extracting parameters such as signal-to-noise ratio, binary source mass, distance, and arrival time.
* Developed an algorithm to calculate the match between raw gravitational wave data and template wave data.
* Used Python to plot orbits of binary sources using the Predictor and Corrector method, varying source mass, and calculating initial positions and velocities based on Kepler’s law.

### CERN Korean Summer Student Program, _2023.06.26 - 2023.07.08_ 

* Attended lectures covering various topics including the Standard Model, detectors, data analysis, particle accelerator technology challenges, beam dynamics, and statistics. 	
* Visited sites including the Synchrocyclotron, Data Centre Visitor Point, Alice exhibition, CMS Cavern, LEIR, DUNE prototype, and CCC.	
* Studied the principles of Monte Carlo simulation and gained understanding of how GEANT4 works. 
* Presented on the principles of detector simulations to peers and professors from the ALICE and CMS collaborations. 

### Study Groups
* Classical Theory of Fields Study,	_2022.12 - 2023.02_
