    * Studied the principles and structures of Transmission Electron Microscopy(TEM).
    * Participated in discussions on spot detection algorithms for TEM data analysis.


### UnderGraduate Research Program
* Theoretical Particle Physics Research Lab, Sungkyunkwan University, _2023.12- 2024.01_
    * Topic: “Identifying Dark Matter-Neutrino Interaction via Gravitational Wave Lensing and Neutrino Lensing”
    * Analyzed the geometric framework of gravitational lensing of light, calculating deflection angle, magnification, and time delay based on the lensing source.
    * Explored gravitational wave lensing, examining the relationship between source size and gravitational wavelength, and calculating magnification.
    * Studied Beyond Standard model neutrino interactions during propagation to Earth, including neutrino self-interaction and dark matter-neutrino interaction.
    * Tried to develop a basic methodology for identifying dark matter-neutrino interactions using gravitational lensing of both neutrinos and gravitational waves, incorporating various neutrino interactions.
